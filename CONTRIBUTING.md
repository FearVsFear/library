#Contribute To EDD Code Snippet Library

The EDD code snippet library is a community-maintained repository and so contributions are always welcome.

*Note*: please do not request custom code snippets here. Those fall into the realm of custom development are not something the Easy Digital Downloads team can provide.

## Submitting a Snippet

To submit a code library for inclusion in the library, please fork the repository and then submit a [pull request](http://pippinsplugins.com/submitting-your-first-pull-request/).

Guidelines for submission:

- Each snippet should be placed in it's own file.
- Each file should be named appropriately based on the purpose of the snippet.
- Files should be placed in the appropriate category (folder). If no category exists, you may create one with your pull request.
- All functions and classes should be prefixed with your own unique prefix, preferrably one that contains your initials followed by `_edd_`. For example: `pw_edd_{function name here}`.
